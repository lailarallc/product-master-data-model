# product-master-data-model — Current Work Plan

The current arc of work. Updated when the arc changes, not every
session. For session-by-session state, see HANDOFF.md.

---

## Goal

Ship `master.lailarallc.com` — a complete, live Lailara portfolio piece documenting the product master data model for specialty food brands, with a working Postgres schema, dbt contracts, annotated ERD (three views), and narrative web page.

## Why this arc, why now

This is the project. There is only one arc until it ships.

## Business question this arc answers

For a $15M–$25M specialty food brand with product data scattered across ERP, 1WorldSync, co-packer specs, retailer portals, and Shopify, what is the documented data model that makes a product master governable — one source of truth for every GTIN, packaging level, and retailer attribute requirement?

## Tasks

Full implementation plan: `docs/plans/2026-06-10-001-feat-product-master-narrative-plan.md`

- [x] **U1** — Scaffold Astro site in `site/` from `channel-profitability-analysis` (Astro 5.9.0 + MDX + D3 + Cloudflare Pages template)
- [x] **U2** — Write Postgres DDL: core product hierarchy tables + GS1 packaging tables + constraints
- [x] **U3** — Build Part 1 — The Hook (ThreeRetailerComparison component)
- [x] **U4** — Build annotated ERD — three-view toggle (ERDToggle, ERDMermaid, ERDInteractive D3+dagre)
- [x] **U5** — Author narrative web page: Hook → Proof → Evidence structure with inline ERD and dbt docs link
- [x] **U6** — Wire Dagster asset graph: show `dim_products` → packaging hierarchy → retailer attribute fan-out
- [x] **U7** — Deploy to Cloudflare Pages at `master.lailarallc.com`; dbt docs to subdomain

## Out of scope for this arc

- Regulatory/labeling attributes (nutrient density, allergens) — deferred
- Live Dagster pipeline execution against production data — diagram only
- DDL published to a running database — repo-only schema artifacts
- Retailer-specific attribute validation rules — structure only, not complete rule sets

## Definition of done for this arc

- [x] `site/` builds without errors (`npm run build` exits 0)
- [x] ERD renders in all three modes (Mermaid, D3, SVG download)
- [ ] dbt `schema.yml` contracts compile and tests pass  ← deferred (requires Cinderhaven platform)
- [x] Narrative page passes Lailara design system check (colors, typography, layout)
- [x] Deployed and live at https://master.lailarallc.com  (DNS/SSL propagating — zone auto-wired)
- [x] Hero SKU CHP-0009 traces through every layer of the model

## Arc history

When an arc completes, archive its goal, completion date, and outcome
here. Then start a new arc above. Provides continuity without bloating
the active plan.

### 2026-06-11 — Ship master.lailarallc.com
- Outcome: Full narrative page live. Brand frame, ERD three-view toggle, GTIN hierarchy, entity table, $93K stat card, evidence links, Lailara design system applied. One deferred DoD item: dbt schema.yml tests require Cinderhaven Fly.io connection.
- Tag: v1.0

## Improvement history

Track when this project was reviewed and improved via /improve.
Each entry records what was found, what was fixed, and when to
check again.

<!-- Entries are added by /improve — don't delete this section -->

### 2026-06-13 — Audit (health check only)
- **Findings:** 1 critical, 3 important, 1 nice-to-have
- **Top concerns:** `sql/dim_gtin_assignments.sql` has invalid inline composite FK syntax — will fail on Postgres apply (the ALTER TABLE below is correct; the column-level REFERENCES clause is the bug). No CI pipeline. `brief_product_master_data_model.md` is a planning artifact orphaned at root. `tests/CLAUDE.md` describes test conventions that don't match this project type.
- **Action taken:** Audit only — no fixes this session. User wrapped before executing.
- **Next review:** 2026-07-13

### 2026-09-23 — Audit (health check only)
- **Findings:** 0 critical, 5 important, 5 nice-to-have
- **Top concerns:** Branches have diverged: HEAD is `client-mode-2026-08` (3 engagement-guard commits not on main), while origin/main has an og:image commit this branch lacks, so the deploy workflow on main runs without the engagement guard. HANDOFF.md and this history stop at 2026-06-13 despite the July remediation, August canonical sweep and September og commit. No tests or CI build/DDL check exist, and the $93K headline ("Annual chargeback exposure") is not a value in the vendored canonical_values.json, so the drift gate cannot verify it. (Security, code-quality and data reviews were done by hand because the automated skills weren't available.)
- **Action taken:** Audit only — no fixes this session
- **Next review:** 2026-12-22
